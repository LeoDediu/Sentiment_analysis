## Introduction to Natural Language Processing

NLP is a subset of AI that provides computers ability to process or interact with natural human speech. In NLP, machine learning and deep learning are used on massive amounts of data to obtain the rules and understanding of nuance in human speech.

Sentiment Analysis is MeaningCloud's solution for performing a detailed multilingual sentiment analysis of texts from different sources.

It identifies the positive, negative, neutral polarity in any text, including comments in surveys and social media. It also extracts sentiment at the document or aspect-based level. In order to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified and the relationship between them evaluated, resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text.
